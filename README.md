# deep_learning_DNA
Classifying human DNA sequence and random ATCG sequences, using keras CNN

This is a small tutorial for my lab members, on how to apply deep learning technology in analyzing DNA genome sequences.
I have create an ipython notebook for the analysis pipeline.
To my surprise, the simple network achieves 99% accuracy in classifying DNA sequences from random generate sequences.
A deep neural newtork may probably learn much more from our genome than us.
